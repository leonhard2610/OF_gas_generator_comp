Case for a converging nozzle using Openfoam V13. 

The `Allrun` will run the case as is by calling `Allmesh` and `Allsolve` scripts.  

The case is based on two other projects found online: [RD-107 engine case](https://github.com/AndyShor/RD_107) and [Merlin engine case](https://github.com/Interfluo/OpenFOAM-Cases-Interfluo/tree/main/OpenFOAM-sonicFoam-2D-Merlin-Nozzle-4-main/OpenFOAM-sonicFoam-2D-Merlin-Nozzle-4-main).
